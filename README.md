🐛 Main Issue Faced
Problem:
When rendering events, we needed to check if the user had already booked each event.
However, accessing user data from localStorage inside EventCard was unreliable and insecure.

Root Cause:
The AuthContext was returning cached or partial user info.

Booked events info wasn't always available at component level.

We wanted fresh and secure fetch of the user from /auth/me.

✅ Solution:
Replaced useContext(AuthContext) with direct API fetching using React Query.

Ensured that events load only after the user is fetched.

Updated the logic in EventCard to check user.bookedEvents.includes(event._id).

React Query dependency control:
js
Copy
Edit
const { data: user, isLoading: userLoading } = useQuery(['user'], fetchUser);
const { data: events, isLoading: eventsLoading } = useQuery(['events'], fetchEvents, {
  enabled: !!user,
});
